## Overview
Starting with the customer and working backwards sounds like common sense.  

One challenge in delivery is ensuring _everyone_ is on the same page.  If the documents required to communicate the 
concept are created first, it provides the scope and shared vision on the goal.

> To ensure that a service meets the needs of the customer
> (and not more than that) we use a process called “Working Backwards” 
> in which you start with your customer and work your way backwards until 
> you get to the minimum set of technology requirements to satisfy what you try to achieve. 
> The goal is to drive simplicity through a continuous, explicit customer focus.

## Process
The Working Backwards product definition process to achieve clarity on delivery:

1. Write the Press Release
1. Write a Frequently Asked Questions document
1. Define the customer experience
1. Write the User Manual

> Once we have gone through the process of creating the press release, faq, mockups, and user manuals, it is amazing 
> how much clearer it is what you are planning to build. We'll have a suite of documents that we can use to explain 
> the new product to other teams within Amazon. We know at that point that the whole team has a shared vision on what 
> product we are going the build.
