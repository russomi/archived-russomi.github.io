## Overview
Starting with the customer and working backwards[^1] sounds like common sense.  It is 2019 and [Werner posted about it back
in 2006][1].  It is worth revisiting the process in the context of the problems we try to solve in cloud computing today.

## Process
The Working Backwards product definition process to achieve clarity on delivery:

1. Write the Press Release
1. Write a Frequently Asked Questions document
1. Define the customer experience
1. Write the User Manual

### Press Release
Taken from _How to Write a Press Release_[^2]:

1. Make your headline irresistible.
1. Convey the news's value to the press.
1. Offer a tempting quotable.
1. Provide valuable background information on the subject.
1. Summarize the "who" and the "what" in a boilerplate.

### Press Release Example
The [AWS Chatbot][3] blog post is an example of a press release of a new AWS service.  The post follows the steps to
a press release identified above:

1. Headline - `Introducing AWS Chatbot: ChatOps for AWS`
1. Convey the Value - `Today, AWS introduces a public beta of AWS Chatbot, a new service that enables DevOps teams to 
receive AWS notifications and execute commands in Slack channels and Amazon Chime chat rooms with only minimal effort.`
1. Quotable - `What our customers say`
1. Background information on the subject - `Walkthrough` 
1. Summarize the "who" and "what" - `Conclusion` in addition to the footer of the page 

### Frequently Asked Questions
The purpose of an FAQ is generally to provide information on frequent questions or concerns; however, the format 
is a useful means of organizing information, and text consisting of questions and their answers may thus be called 
an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked[^3].  Shopify has an excellent post 
called [The FAQ Page: Why You Need It, How to Build One, and 10 Great Examples][5]. Answer questions to reduce 
customer frustration.
