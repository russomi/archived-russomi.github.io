## Overview
Starting with the customer and working backwards[^1] sounds like common sense.  It is 2019 and [Werner posted about it back
in 2006][1].  It is worth revisiting the process in the context of the problems we try to solve in cloud computing today.

One challenge in delivery is ensuring _everyone_ is on the same page.  If the documents required to communicate the 
concept are created first, it provides the scope and shared vision on the goal.

## Process
