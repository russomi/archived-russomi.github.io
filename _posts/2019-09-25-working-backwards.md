## Overview
Starting with the customer and working backwards[^1] sounds like common sense.  It is 2019 and [Werner posted about it back
in 2006][1].  It is worth revisiting the process in the context of the problems we try to solve in cloud computing today.

One challenge in delivery is ensuring _everyone_ is on the same page.  If the documents required to communicate the 
concept are created first, it provides the scope and shared vision on the goal.

## Process
The Working Backwards product definition process to achieve clarity on delivery:

1. Write the Press Release
1. Write a Frequently Asked Questions document
1. Define the customer experience
1. Write the User Manual

### Press Release
Taken from _How to Write a Press Release_[^2]:

1. Make your headline irresistible.
1. Convey the news's value to the press.
1. Offer a tempting quotable.
1. Provide valuable background information on the subject.
1. Summarize the "who" and the "what" in a boilerplate.

The [AWS Chatbot][3] blog post is an example of a press release of a new AWS service.
